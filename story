Story Concept (Working Title: Azad 2 ’90s hero)

Present Timeline:

Nagarjun, a happy father, living abroad with his small family.

His children adore him until they uncover an old truth: in the 1990s, their loving father was once a thief in India.

Shocked, they reject his wealth and begin struggling on their own, trying to detach from his tainted past.


Turning Point:

As they dig deeper, they discover he wasn’t a criminal in the traditional sense — he was a Robinhood figure.

Past Timeline (Flashback – 30 to 45 mins of story):

The film then dives into Nagarjun’s youth as Azad in the 1990s.

His transformation: how circumstances pushed him to become a thief.

But instead of robbing innocents, he targeted the corrupt, greedy, and oppressive.

The robberies are shown in a funny, thrilling way — clever tricks, disguises, and witty escapes.

His actions helped the poor and punished the rich exploiters.


Tone & Style:

Family drama + emotional core (present timeline).

Nostalgic, stylish 90s vibe with humor and energy (past timeline).

A blend of heist comedy and emotional father-children reconciliation.


Climax:

The children realize their father was not just a thief but a hero who lived by principles.

They reconcile, carrying forward his values rather than rejecting his past.
